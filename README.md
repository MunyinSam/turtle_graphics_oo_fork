# OO code using turtle graphics
- From the starting code, polygon_art.py, you are to write an OO program that generates different pieces of art works
- Fork, then, clone this repo
- Read the instructions given in the course's Google Classroom and start coding
- Once you are done, push your final code to your Github repo and modify this README to report on the work you have done

First off I followed the guidelines of the class / inheritances and functions that I needed to write from the google doc. Then in the Polygon class the draw function I just copy the draw polygon function that was given and changed it to oop style, the move function i didn't use though. 

Then the embbedded polygon class i made it so it is a subclass from the main one but added reduction ratio. Then the draw function i also copied from the code already given above and loop it twice the get the embbed effect and declare the current size and location outside the loop.

The last PolygonArt class is just called to draw the polygons which retrieves the user inputs. And the function inside is changed with the user input.

From what I tested the code looks good but I just don't know how many polygon you want so i just made it 15.
